if-else:
    we have a condition based on that condition we perform some tasks.
Why should we learn about if-else conditions:
    With the help of if else conditions we can write programs which can take decisions based on conditions
Syntax:
    if(condition){
    //code that we want to execute once the condition is true
    }
we can use any data type to write this condition part with the help of
relational operators (== != > < >= <=). Once the condition is true java executes all of the
code that we write inside the {}

Logical operators:
    Logical operators help us combine multiple conditions. There are 3 main types of
    logical operators AND (&&) OR (||) NOT !
Why we should use logical operators:
    they help us simplify logic.
How does the logical NOT ! works?
    logical NOT operator is used to convert a true value to a false value or a false value to a true value;

EXAMPLE:
    sout !true=> false
    boolean var1=false;
    vari1=!var1;
    sout var1=> true
    String country="Korea";
    if(!country.equals("Korea")){
    sout "You are welcome"
    }

Logical OR ||:
    Logical OR operator helps us combine multiple conditions.
    When we want to execute something as soon as one condition becomes true.
    we should be using logical OR
    true||true=> true
    false||true=> true
    true||false=> true
    false|| false=> false ****only time it is a false (if condition includes a true it will always be true)
