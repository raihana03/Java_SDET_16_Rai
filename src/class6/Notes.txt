Swtich statement:
    in switch statements once variable is checked for multiple values.
    functionality is very similar to else- if statements but switch statements have a lot limitations.
Why we should use switch statements:
    they are very fast.
Syntax:

switch(variable we want to check){
case value1:
    sout;
    break;
case value2:
    sout;
    break;
    default:
        sout;
}

Limitations of switch statements
    1. Only byte short int String and char data types are allowed
    2. we can't use the relational operators (== != > < >= <=)
    2. We can't use the logical operators as well.
